# Linux Programming Notes

This project aims to organize my notes for the Linux Programming course instructed by Jianjian Song.

## Organization

The notes are organized by chapters.

## References

The notes would reference two books:

* Beginning Linux Programming, 4th Edition
* Advanced Programming Unix Environment, 2nd Edition

**Disclaimer**: these documents are *never* intended to be comprehensive and completely correct, although the author tries his best to do so.

If you find some error, don't hesitate to write an issue or send a pull request.
